# Maintain the public template and private mirror

Public SFWA-WTL-TEMPLATE and the private webapp-stack-g1 mirror ship the same
tracked release tree. Their commit histories and local ignored files remain
separate. Compare Git tree hashes, rather than expecting identical commit IDs.
This process is for the reusable template; do not mirror it over an active app.

## Three update paths

| Path | Owner | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone defaults | Public dotSYSTEMX | `systemx:upstream:check` / explicit `systemx:upstream:import` |
| Webapp and host operations | This template | App/LAN/KIT/setup changes and `sync:system:check` |
| Public/private parity | Reviewed template maintainer | `scripts/sync-template.py` and Git publication |

An upstream import does not update the other webapp repository or publish a wiki.
Host governance sync does not import standalone defaults or mirror a repository.
Each operation has a separate preview/check and explicit mutation boundary.

## Review and validate the source

Confirm the branch, remotes, live main revisions and local changes before work.
Preserve existing changes and ignored state. Reconcile public-only and
private-only features deliberately; keep managed releases immutable and
research manifests consistent. Ship blank context/plan/task/memory seeds, and
keep secrets, active project records and local runtime state outside the release.

```bash
npm ci
npm run sync:system:check
npm run ci:all
npm run deploy -- hosting --preflight
```

If host generated metadata needs updating, review `npm run sync:system` changes
and repeat the affected checks. Version the app independently of the managed
standalone release. Documentation-only updates can retain the app version.
The `webapp-version/` directory avoids a case-insensitive collision with
standalone `VERSION`.

Commit the reviewed source before mirroring. Use its own repository's normal
Git workflow and publication authorization; do not import private Git history
into the public repository.

## Preview and apply the mirror

```bash
python3 -B scripts/sync-template.py --target /path/to/template-mirror
python3 -B scripts/sync-template.py --target /path/to/template-mirror --apply
```

Both checkouts must be clean. The tool stages a tracked source archive,
validates it, then copies tracked files only. Review the target diff and commit
it in the target repository. The tool deliberately refuses local-only collisions
and file/directory transitions rather than discarding those files.

```bash
npm run template:check -- --against /path/to/template-mirror
git rev-parse 'HEAD^{tree}'
```

Parity includes paths, file contents and executable modes. It excludes `.git`,
ignored dependencies, build output, environment files and local session state.
Preserve those local resources under their own project policies.

## Publish and verify

Publish each reviewed main branch, then compare local HEAD with live remote refs
and confirm both committed trees match. Existing histories remain intact.

Run in each repository:

```bash
npm run wiki:check
npm run wiki:sync
```

The wiki script derives its destination from that checkout's GitHub origin.
It copies checked-in Markdown pages, preserves wiki-only material/history, and
pushes without forcing. Verify the published pages against `wiki/` after sync.
Source publication and wiki publication are separate from Firebase hosting.
