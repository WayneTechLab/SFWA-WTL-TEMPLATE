# .SYSTEMX — SFWA-WTL TEMPLATE operational system

This directory is the **operational control layer** for the template: the launcher
menu, the setup/deploy/quality scripts, git hooks, version tracking, and the full
guided playbook.

> The runnable app lives at the **repo root**. `.SYSTEMX/` is the tooling that
> sets it up, deploys it, and keeps it healthy.

This template is Firebase-first and locally verifiable. Use local verification
scripts and direct Firebase deploys from the workstation instead of runner-
based automation.

```

Or make it typeable in any terminal:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/install-command.sh   # then just type: WSG-MENU
```

## AI and tool automation standard

Generic agent coordination, browser automation, external connector, and
recovery rules live in [AI/](AI/README.md). These files define Agent 0,
subagent lanes, message envelopes, Playwright and Chrome DevTools MCP routing,
desktop automation boundaries, popup/apply recovery, and external service
adapter rules without carrying private project-specific vendor logic.

Run the local drift check with:

```bash
npm run ai:standard:check
npm run docs:links
```

## Webflow-class Designer research

`.SYSTEMX/LAN/Research/Webflow/` contains the validated clean-room research
package and its 13-wave implementation overlay. The current capability truth
is the checked-in
[`LAN/Builder/contracts/capability-manifest.json`](LAN/Builder/contracts/capability-manifest.json);
`npm test` is the first characterization gate. Future Designer schemas remain
draft contracts until their wave exit criteria, source ownership, migrations,
tests, documentation, and rollback evidence are complete.

## SYSTEMX Kits

Reusable brand, media, platform, web, mobile, and document production assets
live in [`KIT/Production/`](KIT/Production/SYSTEMX-KIT-INDEX.md).

Use this as both:

- a local SYSTEMX tool source for approved Wayne Tech Lab LLC production assets;
- a standalone GitHub folder that LLMs, SDKs, CLIs, MCP tools, and browser
  agents can read directly when generating brand-compliant output.

Start with [`KIT/Production/SYSTEMX-KIT-INDEX.md`](KIT/Production/SYSTEMX-KIT-INDEX.md).

The Brand Guide Kit lives in
[`KIT/Brand/`](KIT/Brand/SYSTEMX-KIT-INDEX.md). It packages the WTL Brand Guide
Standard Template v1.0 for producing six-page brand-guidelines PDFs from
approved logos, intake answers, page prompts, and local preflight/stitch scripts.

## SYSTEMX LAN builder

The local builder plan lives in [`LAN/`](LAN/README.md). It is designed to
re-imagine the reusable visual-CMS patterns from
[WTL-Instatic](https://github.com/WayneTechLab/WTL-Instatic) for this
Firebase/Vite template. The target is the current checkout in
`template-edit` mode: inspect and safely edit existing pages, routes, modules,
tokens, collections, and assets while previewing through Vite and Firebase
emulators.

The builder's provider model keeps the storage choices explicit:

- Firestore and optional Realtime Database for document/realtime workloads;
- Firebase SQL Connect backed by Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for relational workloads;
- Cloud Storage for Firebase for web media;
- Google Drive/Shared Drive for operator documents and production-kit files;
- Google Cloud Storage for approved internal archive workflows.

These are separate capabilities with separate security and sync rules. The LAN
surface is loopback-only, runs outside the public app build, and delegates
quality, security, and deploy authority to the existing `.SYSTEMX` CLI.

The LAN is also the planned co-management control plane for the codebase:
named tool actions, backend/source diagnostics, humanized run states,
sanitized logs, Agent 0 checkpoints, subagent handoffs, provider preflight, and
last-deploy evidence. See
[`LAN/CONTROL-PLANE-PLAN.md`](LAN/CONTROL-PLANE-PLAN.md) for the execution
waves and safety contract. Backend function or provider-file editing remains
gated until its file-class validator, backup, diff, secret scan, and post-write
quality checks exist.

Start the current-template LAN builder with:

```bash
npm run systemx:lan
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7331/
```

Or start the public Vite app and LAN shell together:

```bash
npm run dev:systemx
```

That exposes:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/             # public app
http://127.0.0.1:5173/__systemx/   # LAN through Vite dev proxy
http://127.0.0.1:7331/             # LAN direct loopback service
```

If another local project already owns `5173` or `7331`, `dev:systemx` checks
both `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, chooses the next free port, records the session in
ignored `.SYSTEMX/state/local-session.json`, and prints the active URLs. Use
the session controls for start-of-day/end-of-day ownership:

```bash
npm run systemx:session:status
npm run systemx:session:stop
```

This G1 builder shows controller health, Vite preview status, repository state,
builder waves, route inventory, provider readiness, source files, page models,
typed modules, CMS/CRM fixtures, and local account fixtures. It can write
allowlisted local source and model changes only with a session token, backup,
secret scan, operation evidence, and explicit confirmation. The workspace and
provider contracts are under `LAN/Builder/`; live cloud mutations remain
separate authenticated adapters and the existing `.SYSTEMX` quality/deploy
gates remain authoritative.

The active UI contract is canvas-first: left structure dock, center Vite
preview, right tool rail, right inspector closed by default, and a `Layers`
bottom dock for page-model work. Local evidence is documented in
[`../wiki/SYSTEMX-Logs-and-Evidence.md`](../wiki/SYSTEMX-Logs-and-Evidence.md)
and recorded under ignored LAN runtime folders.

### Webflow-class Designer research overlay

The local builder has a research-backed future architecture under
[`LAN/Research/Webflow/`](LAN/Research/Webflow/). It includes 29 research
documents, 200 source records, a 13-wave roadmap, risks, acceptance criteria,
Wiki repair work, and draft Designer contracts. The canonical implementation
plan is [`LAN/WEBFLOW-DEEP-RESEARCH-MASTER-PLAN.md`](LAN/WEBFLOW-DEEP-RESEARCH-MASTER-PLAN.md)
and the current gate is [`status/WEBFLOW-LAN-MASTERPLAN.md`](status/WEBFLOW-LAN-MASTERPLAN.md).

The current G1 LAN remains the supported implementation: a guarded local
current-template editor with page/node/module/CMS fixtures, source inspection,
allowlisted writes, backups, evidence, and Vite preview. The full visual
Designer is **not** advertised as complete. Research Wave 0 truth, safety,
documentation, and characterization now pass; Wave 1 modular kernel work is
not started. Use `npm test` to run the current LAN characterization suite before
changing the editor kernel.

## Tooling the bootstrap guarantees

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js + npm | runtime | Build/dev + package manager |
| Git | CLI | Version control |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | CLI | Repo + secrets automation |
| Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) | SDK/CLI | GCP/Firebase platform |
| Firebase CLI (`firebase-tools`) | CLI | Provisioning + deploy, resolved from PATH or `npx --yes firebase-tools` |
| Firebase Web SDK (`firebase`) | SDK | App auth/data/storage (in `package.json`) |
| Stripe CLI (`stripe`) | CLI | Payments (optional) |
| Stripe SDK (`@stripe/stripe-js`, `stripe`) | SDK | Payments (optional) |

Google/Firebase is the default cloud and sender path. When the project needs
more provider coverage, run:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/bootstrap.sh --with-stripe --with-mcp --with-m365 --with-godaddy --interactive-login
```

Use `Unified-Login.md` for the five-step login flow,
`WSG-Account-Levels.md` for Level 0-5 Firebase, security, emulator, and
Playwright standards, and `Firebase-Sender-Auth-MFA.md` for the sender email,
authorized-domain, MFA, claims, and smoke-test order that prevents unified login
drift.

Use the stack definitions in `.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/stacks/` to keep
`Google/Firebase` as the default setup path, `Microsoft 365` as the alternative
sender/tenant path, and `Custom` as the explicit service-selection path.

See [status/](status/TODO.md) for the build log and [version/CHANGELOG.md](version/CHANGELOG.md).

## First-Time Setup Intake

When a repo is opened from this template as a new project, run:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/first-time-setup-packet.sh --pause
```

The script asks `Mac` or `Windows` first, then stack mode, edition, packet
tier, and packet shape. It exports one setup zip to Downloads, pauses for
external work, imports the returned zip into `.SYSTEMX/Setup-Input_MD/`, and
then continues the guided setup.

Fill the intake and master-plan files in `.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/intake/`,
then re-inject `06-AI-REINJECTION-PROMPT.md` into the AI/code tooling session.
Setup/deploy events append to `.SYSTEMX/logs/setup-history.jsonl` and
`.SYSTEMX/logs/deploy-history.jsonl`.

For the full scratch-to-production flow, read
[`USER-INGEST-AND-PRODUCTION-SETUP.md`](USER-INGEST-AND-PRODUCTION-SETUP.md).

## Deploy Controls

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh --preflight
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh hosting --dry-run
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh rules
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh app --fast
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh --check
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh --rollback-info
```

Firebase CLI is no longer vendored into app dev dependencies; scripts resolve it
from local PATH or `npx --yes firebase-tools` to keep generated apps audit-clean.

## Governance sync

Run WSG-AGI before releases to validate the operational layer:

```bash
npm run sync:system:check
npm run sync:system
npm run auth:mfa:check
```

## Unified setup

The modular edition-aware setup process lives at
[`Unified-Setup-Process/`](Unified-Setup-Process/). It defines stack modes, five
edition manifests, the 20-phase canonical master plan, the 10-phase/15-step
compatibility flow, repo learning, and the
[`@@CODER.SatoshiUNO`](Unified-Setup-Process/standards/@@CODER.SatoshiUNO.md)
human/AI interaction standard.

The original [`Template/steps/`](Template/steps/) flow remains the legacy
golden-path source material.

## Standard MD files

Use [`Standard-MD-Files/`](Standard-MD-Files/) when a human needs the source set
that WSG uses to build setup packet zips for an LLM to produce an updated
template version, initialize a new project from the template, or continue setup
without relying on chat memory.

Run this to export one setup packet zip to the user's Downloads folder and
create a matching setup import target:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/build-setup-packet.sh
```

The script asks the operator for OS, stack mode, edition, packet tier, and
packet shape, then writes a timestamped zip to the OS Downloads folder.

After receiving an updated setup zip, import and validate it with:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/import-setup-packet.sh
```
