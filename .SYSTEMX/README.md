# .SYSTEMX — WebApp Stack G One Point Zero operational system

This directory is the **operational control layer** for the template: the launcher
menu, the setup/deploy/quality scripts, git hooks, version tracking, and the full
guided playbook.

> The runnable app lives at the **repo root**. `.SYSTEMX/` is the tooling that
> sets it up, deploys it, and keeps it healthy.

For multi-agent work, read [`docs/AGENT-OPERATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-OPERATIONS.md)
and claim a lane in [`status/AGENTS.md`](status/AGENTS.md) before editing.
The formal coordinator/subagent contract is in
[`docs/project/agent-0-subagent-loop.md`](docs/project/agent-0-subagent-loop.md).

This operating layer is powerful and changes frequently. Fork, clone, or copy
it at your own risk; inspect changes before production use. Subagents multiply
token and tool usage, so bounded lanes and report-backs are required.

## Platform baseline

`.SYSTEMX` is currently based on **macOS on Apple Silicon hardware** for terminal
commands and local automation. The happy path expects a modern Mac with `zsh`,
Homebrew, Node/npm, Git, GitHub CLI, Google Cloud SDK, Firebase CLI, and optional
Stripe/MCP tooling.

Windows is tracked as a separate edition family for **Windows x64** and
**Windows ARM64** operators. Use the Windows setup packet/terminal notes and
verify every generated command before production use. Native Ubuntu/Linux
coverage is planned soon; for now, Linux/WSL references are compatibility notes
unless a project explicitly validates that lane.

## Start here

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/WSG-MENU.sh
```

Or make it typeable in any terminal:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/install-command.sh   # then just type: WSG-MENU
```

## Tooling the bootstrap guarantees

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js + npm | runtime | Build/dev + package manager |
| Git | CLI | Version control |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | CLI | Repo + secrets automation |
| Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) | SDK/CLI | GCP/Firebase platform |
| Firebase CLI (`firebase-tools`) | CLI | Provisioning + deploy, resolved from PATH or `npx --yes firebase-tools` |
| Firebase Web SDK (`firebase`) | SDK | App auth/data/storage (in `package.json`) |
| Stripe CLI (`stripe`) | CLI | Payments (optional) |
| Stripe SDK (`@stripe/stripe-js`, `stripe`) | SDK | Payments (optional) |

Google/Firebase is the default cloud and sender path. When the project needs
more provider coverage, run:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/bootstrap.sh --with-stripe --with-mcp --with-m365 --with-godaddy --interactive-login
```

Use `Unified-Login.md` for the five-step login flow,
`WSG-Account-Levels.md` for Level 0-5 Firebase, security, emulator, and
Playwright standards, and `Firebase-Sender-Auth-MFA.md` for the sender email,
authorized-domain, MFA, claims, and smoke-test order that prevents unified login
drift.

Use the stack definitions in `.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/stacks/` to keep
`Google/Firebase` as the default setup path, `Microsoft 365` as the alternative
sender/tenant path, and `Custom` as the explicit service-selection path.

See [status/](status/TODO.md) for the build log and [version/CHANGELOG.md](version/CHANGELOG.md).

## First-Time Setup Intake

When a repo is opened from this template as a new project, run:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/first-time-setup-packet.sh --pause
```

The script asks `Mac` or `Windows` first. Choose `Mac` for the primary Apple
Silicon macOS terminal path, or `Windows` for the Windows x64/ARM64 edition
path. It then asks stack mode, edition, packet tier, and packet shape. It
exports one setup zip to Downloads, pauses for
external work, imports the returned zip into `.SYSTEMX/Setup-Input_MD/`, and
then continues the guided setup.

Fill the intake and master-plan files in `.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/intake/`,
then re-inject `06-AI-REINJECTION-PROMPT.md` into the AI/code tooling session.
Setup/deploy events append to `.SYSTEMX/logs/setup-history.jsonl` and
`.SYSTEMX/logs/deploy-history.jsonl`.

For the full scratch-to-production flow, read
[`USER-INGEST-AND-PRODUCTION-SETUP.md`](USER-INGEST-AND-PRODUCTION-SETUP.md).

## Deploy Controls

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh --preflight
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh hosting --dry-run
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh rules
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh app --fast
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh --check
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh --rollback-info
```

Firebase CLI is no longer vendored into app dev dependencies; scripts resolve it
from local PATH or `npx --yes firebase-tools` to keep generated apps audit-clean.

## Governance sync

Run WSG-AGI before releases to validate the operational layer:

```bash
npm run sync:system:check
npm run sync:system
npm run auth:mfa:check
```

## Unified setup

The modular edition-aware setup process lives at
[`Unified-Setup-Process/`](Unified-Setup-Process/). It defines stack modes, five
edition manifests, the 20-phase canonical master plan, the 10-phase/15-step
compatibility flow, repo learning, and the
[`@@CODER.SatoshiUNO`](Unified-Setup-Process/standards/@@CODER.SatoshiUNO.md)
human/AI interaction standard.

The original [`Template/steps/`](Template/steps/) flow remains the legacy
golden-path source material.

## Standard MD files

Use [`Standard-MD-Files/`](Standard-MD-Files/) when a human needs the source set
that WSG uses to build setup packet zips for an LLM to produce an updated
template version, initialize a new project from the template, or continue setup
without relying on chat memory.

Run this to export one setup packet zip to the user's Downloads folder and
create a matching setup import target:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/build-setup-packet.sh
```

The script asks the operator for OS, stack mode, edition, packet tier, and
packet shape, then writes a timestamped zip to the OS Downloads folder.

After receiving an updated setup zip, import and validate it with:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/import-setup-packet.sh
```
