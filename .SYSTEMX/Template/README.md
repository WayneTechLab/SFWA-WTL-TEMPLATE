# WebApp Stack G One Point Zero

> **A reusable, enterprise-grade, vendor-neutral blueprint for spinning up a
> TypeScript + React + Vite + Firebase + Stripe web application — over and over,
> the same way, every time.**

This `Template/` directory is a **portable golden path**. Drop it into any new
repository (or pull it from GitHub) and an engineer — or an AI agent — can follow
the steps in order to stand up a production-ready web application from a bare
machine to a deployed, monitored, billing-enabled product.

It is intentionally **generic**. No business names, no hard-coded project IDs, no
customer data. Everything that is project-specific is collected during the
**Interview** step and injected into the generated files.

## How to use this template

There are four supported modes. Pick the one that matches your situation.

| Mode | When to use | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **🎛️ Control menu** | You want one launcher for tooling, config, setup, deploy. | Run [`.SYSTEMX/WSG-MENU.sh`](../WSG-MENU.sh) and pick an option. |
| **⚡ Fast start (copy)** | You just want a running app NOW. | Copy the [`starter/`](./starter/) folder → `npm install` → `npm run dev`. |
| **⚡ Fast start (GitHub)** | Start a new repo from the live template. | `gh repo create my-app --template WayneTechLab/webapp-stack-g1 --private --clone` |
| **Guided (agent)** | You are driving an AI coding agent. | Feed it [`WEBAPP-STACK-G1.0.md`](./WEBAPP-STACK-G1.0.md), then the `steps/` files one at a time. |
| **Guided (human)** | You are a developer doing it by hand. | Read [`WEBAPP-STACK-G1.0.md`](./WEBAPP-STACK-G1.0.md), then work through `steps/00` → `steps/12`. |
| **Scripted** | You want an interactive bootstrap. | Run [`setup.sh`](./setup.sh) and answer the prompts. |
| **Unified setup** | You want edition-aware setup (Enterprise, Business, Consumer, WSGT, WSGD). | Start at [`../Unified-Setup-Process/README.md`](../Unified-Setup-Process/README.md). |

### 🎛️ The control menu (recommended starting point)

[`WSG-MENU.sh`](../WSG-MENU.sh) (in `.SYSTEMX/`) is a single launcher that ties
everything together with submenus:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/WSG-MENU.sh
```

### Unified setup and @@CODER.SatoshiUNO

For new modular builds, prefer the unified setup process:
[`../Unified-Setup-Process/`](../Unified-Setup-Process/). It keeps the legacy
steps as source material while adding edition manifests, page caps, repo
learning, and the
[`@@CODER.SatoshiUNO`](../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/@@CODER.SatoshiUNO.md)
human/AI interaction contract.

```
1) 🚀 Start Template into Production   guided one-time setup → live
2) Setup & Tooling   bootstrap · auth · capture Firebase · seed env · guided setup · hooks
3) Deploy            Full · hosting · rules · functions · preflight · bump+deploy
4) Quality Checks    TypeScript · ESLint · tests · audit
5) Version           Bump patch/minor/major · changelog
6) Firebase          Login · projects · emulator · indexes · setup
7) Git               Status · pull · commit · push
8) Dev & App         Install · dev · build · preview
9) Project Info      Versions · repo · recent commits
```

**Option 1 (🚀 Start Template into Production)** is the recommended path: a single
guided, one-time, secure wizard — tooling → identity → paste your Firebase/Google
config (or a raw `.env` block) → seed `.env.local` + `.secrets.env` → ingest your
project build-spec `.md` → install/build → deploy → a reminder to **delete the AI
chat** since live keys were handled.

Make the menu typeable in any terminal:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/install-command.sh   # then just type: WSG-MENU
```

The **Setup & Tooling** submenu also includes a **Full bootstrap** that installs,
authenticates, and verifies every SDK + CLI in one pass (Node, Git, `gh`,
`gcloud`, Firebase, optional Stripe) — or run it directly:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/bootstrap.sh --with-stripe --with-mcp --interactive-login
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/bootstrap.sh --with-stripe --with-mcp --with-m365 --with-godaddy --interactive-login
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/bootstrap.sh --check
```

Google/Firebase is the default cloud and sender path. Select Microsoft 365 when
the sender/workforce mailbox is Microsoft-managed, and select GoDaddy when DNS
is managed there. The provider flow is documented in
[`../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/Unified-Login.md`](../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/Unified-Login.md).

Auth and tests use the Level 0-5 account ladder in
[`../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/WSG-Account-Levels.md`](../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/WSG-Account-Levels.md).

Before asking an AI/code tool to build project-specific features, fill the
first-time setup packet in
[`../Unified-Setup-Process/intake/`](../Unified-Setup-Process/intake/). The
scripted path shows these files and pauses:

```bash
bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/first-time-setup-packet.sh --pause
```

Inside **Setup & Tooling → Capture Firebase project info** you paste the
Google/Firebase project info you received for each platform — the Web
`firebaseConfig` block, the iOS `GoogleService-Info.plist`, and the Android
`google-services.json` (point it at the file and it auto-parses, or type the
fields in).

For Web, you can paste the **full Firebase SDK snippet** exactly as copied from
Firebase, including imports, comments, blank lines, `firebaseConfig`,
`initializeApp`, and `getAnalytics`. End the paste with `WSG_END` on its own
line. Template examples use shape-matched masked values such as
`AIzaSyCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` and `000000000000`.

The starter app validates the template with five basic pages: Home, About,
Services, Docs, and Contact. Its default visual baseline is black, white, and
neutral gray only; see
[`../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/WSG-Basic-Visual-Baseline.md`](../Unified-Setup-Process/standards/WSG-Basic-Visual-Baseline.md).

The **Deploy** submenu drives [`.SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh`](../scripts/deploy.sh)
— a generic pipeline that runs quality gates → build → version/changelog →
commit → push → Firebase deploy, with **smart targets** (it only deploys what
your `firebase.json` actually defines, so the baseline app deploys hosting +
rules, and functions are added automatically once you create `functions/`).
It also supports target modes (`hosting`, `rules`, `functions`, `app`),
`--dry-run`, `--check`, `--rollback-info`, `--fast`, and background mode.

### The golden rule: one step at a time, in order

The setup is broken into numbered steps. **Do not skip ahead.** Each step:

1. States its **goal** and **preconditions**.
2. Prompts the operator for any **decisions / inputs** it needs.
3. Performs the work (commands + generated files).
4. Ends with a **verification gate** — you must pass it before moving on.

This ordering exists because later steps depend on artifacts (env vars, project
IDs, service accounts, price IDs) produced by earlier steps.

## Quick start (TL;DR)

**Option A — copy the local starter folder and finish the project:**

```bash
# 1. Copy the runnable app out of this template into your new project:
cp -R .SYSTEMX/Template/starter ~/projects/my-app   # or anywhere you like
cd ~/projects/my-app

# 2. Install + run — the app boots even before Firebase is configured:
npm install
npm run dev                 # → http://localhost:5173

# 3. Add your Firebase web config, then deploy:
cp .env.example .env.local  # fill VITE_FIREBASE_* from the Firebase console
npm run build
# (optional) bash .SYSTEMX/scripts/deploy.sh hosting --dry-run

# 4. Make it a fresh git repo / push to GitHub:
rm -rf .git && git init && git add -A && git commit -m "chore: init from WebApp Stack G1"
gh repo create my-app --private --source=. --push
```

**Option B — start straight from the live GitHub template:**

```bash
gh repo create my-app --template WayneTechLab/webapp-stack-g1 --private --clone
cd my-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

**Option C — full guided build (provisioning, Stripe, Functions, CI, monitoring):**

```bash
cd .SYSTEMX/Template
bash setup.sh               # interactive — walks every step with verification gates
# ...or use Unified-Setup-Process first, then work WEBAPP-STACK-G1.0.md steps as needed.
```

## Conventions used in every step file

- **🎯 Goal** — what "done" means for this step.
- **✅ Preconditions** — what must already be true before you start.
- **❓ Operator prompts** — questions to ask the human running the setup.
- **⌨️ Commands** — copy-paste-able shell, parameterized by `${PLACEHOLDERS}`.
- **📄 Generated files** — files this step creates or modifies.
- **🔒 Security notes** — guardrails to never violate.
- **🚦 Verification gate** — the check that must pass to advance.

Placeholders are written as `${SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE}` and are resolved from the
answers captured in [`templates/interview.answers.template`](./templates/interview.answers.template)
during step 01.

## Versioning

`G One Point Zero` = **Generation 1.0**. Bump the generation when you make a
breaking change to the step order or the baseline stack (e.g. swapping the build
tool). Patch the individual step files freely.
