# 08 Design Standard

Use this file when an LLM is designing or updating Web Stack Generation UI.

## Default Template Design

The base template is intentionally plain:

- Colors: black, white, and neutral gray.
- Shape: restrained radius, default 8px or less unless a component needs less.
- Typography: readable system sans, no viewport-scaled font sizes.
- Layout: practical app-first pages, not a marketing landing page by default.
- Motion: minimal and purposeful.
- Visual identity: no project-specific brand color, mascot, illustration style,
  logo system, or decorative gradient until a project intake defines it.

## UI Rules

- Build the usable app or tool as the first screen.
- Use cards only for repeated items, dialogs, and genuinely framed tools.
- Do not nest cards inside cards.
- Use icons for common actions when available.
- Keep dashboards and operational tools dense, scannable, and calm.
- Keep buttons and controls stable in size; hover/focus states must not shift
  layout.
- Make text fit its container at mobile and desktop widths.
- Keep section structure simple: full-width bands or unframed constrained
  layouts.
- Avoid one-note palettes and decorative orbs/blobs.

## Design Inputs To Ask For

Ask the human for these only when they are not already in intake files:

- Brand name and positioning.
- Primary audience.
- Required tone: utilitarian, premium, playful, editorial, technical, luxury,
  healthcare, finance, education, or other.
- Logo availability.
- Color restrictions.
- Required inspiration references.
- Accessibility constraints.
- Content density preference.

## Required Design Output

When producing a design update, include:

- Page inventory.
- Component inventory.
- Color/token notes.
- Layout notes.
- Responsive behavior.
- Accessibility notes.
- Files changed.
- Screenshot/test instructions when visual verification is needed.
