VALIDATION PASSED
```

The validator is offline. It proves package structure, counts, JSON validity, and checksums. The separate research pass live-resolution reviewed all 200 catalog entries on 2026-08-05, with canonical-route confirmation used for redirected, reorganized, or unusually large pages. Neither check guarantees that third-party URLs will remain unchanged after the research cut.
