# Update Log

This page is the public-facing update log for S.F.W.A. Template. README is the
landing page; release history belongs here and in `.SYSTEMX/version/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Unreleased local working tree

- Added the fuller standard public route pack: icon-rail `/`, `/about`,
  `/contact`, `/social`; public `/services`, `/features`, `/docs`, `/faq`,
  `/support`, `/security`; governance `/accessibility`, `/privacy`, `/terms`,
  `/changelog`; and system-state `/403`, `/500`, `/offline`.
- Updated the site drawer to use a compact horizontal four-icon primary row,
  a separate public-pages stack, a claim-gated staff section, and a bottom
  Login Portal bar so the default shell better matches the template standard.
- Added the shared Firebase Auth provider registry and local-emulator
  email/password flow for the public `/login` route.
- Added the claim-gated `/admin` management shell for CMS/CRM, Cloud, Stripe,
  SEO, and SYSTEMX LAN entry points without granting browser-side authority.
- Added LAN `/api/auth/providers` status and a Unified Authentication panel that
  reports the actual dynamic emulator ports and fail-closed Google,
  email-link/code, custom-token, and OIDC/SAML readiness states.
- Updated `dev:systemx` to own Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage emulator
  children with automatic port selection, session ownership, and cleanup so it
  cannot attach to another local project's familiar ports.
- Added the unified-auth contract, structure/test coverage, root/.SYSTEMX docs,
  and the [Unified Login and Admin Operations](Unified-Login-and-Admin-Operations)
  wiki page.
- Added the Style inspector Font browser with a checked-in offline Google Fonts
  catalog, optional server-side Google Fonts Developer API metadata, live Vite
  `document.fonts` inventory, CSS2 preview loading, and guarded project font
  writes using `SAVE FONT CHANGE`.
- Added independent editor dock visibility controls. Left and right menus now
  report `Auto` or `Always shown`, support an explicit Keep open confirmation,
  and reconcile collapsed/pinned state on every layout save so refreshes and
  editor saves do not unexpectedly close a working menu.
- Aligned the public `/login` and Level 4/5 `/admin` front-end with the LAN
  status read model. Both local surfaces now show the owned Vite/Firebase
  session, dynamic emulator ports, current-template mode, provider state,
  repository/data evidence, and detected tooling; admin cards no longer claim
  every backend surface is green, and production correctly describes the LAN
  as documentation-only.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-08-05

- Added the full [SYSTEMX LAN Operations Manual](SYSTEMX-LAN-Operations-Manual)
  and [SYSTEMX LAN API Reference](SYSTEMX-LAN-API-Reference), covering the
  dynamic session supervisor, safe ports, builder screen map, guarded writes,
  local provider lanes, ingest, evidence, security boundaries, and staff
  start/end-of-day handoff sequence.

- Integrated the validated `SFWA-WTL-WEBFLOW-RESEARCH-MASTER-PLAN-v1.0.0`
  clean-room research package under `.SYSTEMX/LAN/Research/Webflow/`:
  200 sources, 29 research documents, 13 roadmap waves, feature/backlog
  matrices, risks, acceptance criteria, and Wiki repair work.
- Added the research-backed Webflow-class Designer master plan, status board,
  Wiki page, and nine draft Designer contracts while preserving the current
  G1 LAN implementation boundary and explicitly labeling later waves planned.
- Added `npm test` LAN characterization coverage for loopback health,
  current-repository read models, session-token mutation authority,
  allowlisted source paths, and runtime/API isolation.
- Added the supported/guarded/planned capability manifest, schema promotion
  decisions, Wave 0 evidence packet, and `npm run docs:links` extensionless Wiki
  link validation.
- Repaired stale Wiki installer/command/version claims, restored the missing
  Step 04 environment/secrets guide, and replaced AI secret-paste guidance with
  a never-paste policy plus rotation procedure.

- Moved responsive preview controls into a centered editor application bar
  outside the canvas, with exact pixel width, named Apple/Android presets, and
  Fit mode.
- Converted Evidence into an on-demand drawer instead of permanent screen
  content.
- Added same-origin live preview inspection with hover/click selection,
  route/source/DOM location, parent selection, source and Navigator actions,
  and review-gated module/component staging.
- Added a mandatory public-build isolation scan; developer source hints remain
  available to LAN in Vite development but are absent from `dist`.
- Added safe selected-text editing with automatic Settings context, local
  Preview/Revert, mapped source opening, explicit guarded save, and one shared
  target across Navigator, Components, breadcrumbs, and the canvas.
- Promoted `.SYSTEMX/LAN` from planning language to the active local
  current-template builder and co-management surface.
- Added the canvas-first LAN designer behavior: left structure dock, center
  Vite preview, right tool rail, closed-by-default inspector, and `Layers`
  bottom dock for page-model work.
- Documented the active local-edit vertical slice: routes/pages, source view
  and save, page metadata, typed node-tree fixtures, CMS/CRM fixtures, user
  fixtures, reusable component registry, and inventory-only existing-project
  ingest.
- Documented LAN evidence and log locations, including local operations JSONL,
  backup snapshots, ingest manifests, component registry exports, and SYSTEMX
  status/update files.
- Synchronized root README, wiki pages, `.SYSTEMX` status docs, and version
  metadata to the advanced SYSTEMX Local Control direction.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-07-31

- Added **WTL Brand Guide Standard Template v1.0** under
  `.SYSTEMX/KIT/Brand/`.
- Added the SYSTEMX-facing Brand Guide Kit index and wiki page.
- Documented the six-page PDF brand-guidelines workflow, prompt-ingest order,
  locked-logo rules, local Python preflight/stitch commands, and LLM entry
  prompt.
- Added Brand Kit anchors to the local structure check.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-07-31

- Added **Wayne Tech Lab LLC. Master Production Kit v1.0** under
  `.SYSTEMX/KIT/Production/`.
- Added `.SYSTEMX/KIT/README.md`, `.SYSTEMX/KIT/Production/SYSTEMX-KIT-INDEX.md`,
  and the wiki [Production Kit](Production-Kit) page.
- Documented dual use: local SYSTEMX production source and standalone GitHub
  folder for LLM/SDK/CLI/MCP/browser-agent consumption.
- Added kit integrity anchors to the SYSTEMX structure check.

## 2.1.1 - 2026-07-31

- Updated the SYSTEMX logo to the exact public product label:
  **S.F.W.A. Template — ".SYSTEMX Forever WebApp" — A Product Provided by Wayne Tech Lab LLC. — Version. Generation 1**.
- Added `docs/assets/systemx-logo.svg` as the deterministic vector master and
  refreshed `docs/assets/systemx-logo.png` as a compatibility render.
- Updated README and wiki home image references, alt text, and product-label copy.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-31

- Added Wayne Tech Lab and SYSTEMX visual assets.
- Reworked the README into a public landing page with calls to action, benefit
  sections, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Updated the wiki home page to read like a branded documentation landing page.
- Added this dedicated update log page.
- Linked WayneTechLab.com, SYSTEMX AI standards, Playwright, Chrome DevTools MCP,
  setup, testing, security, deployment, and wiki pages together.
- Kept connector and vendor language generic so private project-specific IP does
  not enter the public template.
- Replaced the external router dependency with a lightweight local router and
  refreshed the root and starter lockfiles to zero high/critical audit findings.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-07-31

- Removed runner-based workflow automation from the base public template.
- Added `.SYSTEMX/AI` as the generic home for Agent 0, subagent lanes, message
  envelopes, browser/MCP tooling, external connector adapters, and recovery
  playbooks.
- Added `npm run ai:standard:check`, `npm run browser:install`,
  `npm run browser:codegen`, and `npm run mcp:chrome`.
- Added the wiki page [Agent Mesh And Tooling Standard](Agent-Mesh-and-Tooling-Standard).
- Published tag `v2.0.0`.

## Log Policy

- Keep this page human-readable and public.
