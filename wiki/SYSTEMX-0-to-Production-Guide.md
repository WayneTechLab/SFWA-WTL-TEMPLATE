# SYSTEMX 0 → Production Guide

This is the single order of operation for converting S.F.W.A. Template into a
real project. It is designed for a human operator, Agent 0, subagents, local
scripts, provider CLIs/SDKs, browser automation, and MCP tools working together.

## 0. Frame

Define the business outcome, owner, users, constraints, data classification,
budget boundary, acceptance criteria, and release authority. For a larger task,
Agent 0 opens a mission and assigns bounded lanes; no lane receives implicit
deploy, spending, or secret authority.

## 1. Readiness

~~~bash
npm install
npm run wtl:platform -- --json
npm run wtl:doctor -- --strict=false
npm run wtl:setup -- --check
~~~

Use the one-line installer only after reviewing it. Node 24 is the SYSTEMX
target. Primary lanes are Apple Silicon macOS and Windows 11 x64/ARM64; Ubuntu,
Debian, and WSL2 are documented compatibility lanes.

## 2. Learn before editing

Read root README.md, .SYSTEMX/README.md, AGENTS.md, active status files, then
the narrow relevant code and runbook. Use rg, local scripts, and command output
before asking an LLM to reason broadly about the repository.

## 3. Plan

Complete the numbered intake documents under
.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/intake/. Resolve the selected stack and edition,
routes, data, auth, security, integrations, launch criteria, and first wave.
Use a platform-stamped setup packet for secret-free collaboration:

~~~bash
npm run wtl:packet -- export
npm run wtl:packet -- import ./returned-setup-packet.zip
~~~

## 4. Configure

Use ignored local files and provider authentication for Firebase configuration:

~~~bash
npm run wtl:firebase -- login
npm run wtl:firebase -- status
npm run wtl:firebase -- configure --from ./ignored-firebase-config.txt
~~~

Never put real credentials in a prompt, issue, agent bus event, setup packet, or
source-controlled documentation.

## 5. Build with Agent 0

Agent 0 assigns non-overlapping code, docs, browser, security, or release lanes.
Workers report files changed, evidence, checks, blockers, and next action.
SYSTEMX bus traffic is compact and archived at the end of a wave.

~~~bash
npm run wtl:bus -- post --mission launch --wave wave-01 \
  --lane frontend --sender agent-1 --event checkpoint --status in-progress \
  --scope "Build approved routes" --next-action "Run local smoke"
npm run wtl:bus -- summary --mission launch --wave wave-01
~~~

## 6. Prove locally

~~~bash
npm run wtl:local -- start-day
npm run wtl:local -- status
npm run browser:install
npm run browser:codegen
npm run wtl:quality -- --build
npm run wtl:audit
~~~

SYSTEMX selects free loopback ports and records only this repository’s processes.
For Firebase integration work:

~~~bash
npm run wtl:local -- end-day
npm run wtl:local -- start-day --firebase
~~~

Emulator mode dynamically assigns Hosting, UI, Auth, Firestore, and Storage
ports without modifying production firebase.json. The SYSTEMX LAN dashboard
remains local and cannot become a public app route.

## 7. Preflight, deploy, and rollback readiness

~~~bash
git status -sb
npm run ci:all
npm run wtl:deploy -- --preflight
npm run wtl:deploy -- --target hosting --dry-run
~~~

Only after the human confirms the account, Firebase project, branch, target,
cost/compliance impact, rollback path, and local evidence should the operator
run an explicit deploy.

## 8. Handoff and end of day

~~~bash
npm run wtl:sync -- --check
npm run wtl:bus -- archive --mission launch --wave wave-01
npm run wtl:local -- end-day
~~~

Update source docs, status, release notes, and the wiki whenever the public
standard changed. A project is finished when the next operator can reproduce
the local proof and understand its production ownership without hidden chat
context.
