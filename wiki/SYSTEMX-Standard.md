# The SYSTEMX Standard

## A white paper for governed web-app delivery

SYSTEMX is the operational control layer packaged with SFWA-WTL-G1. It provides
an ordered setup process, a shared Node.js menu, reusable intake packets, quality and
security checks, deployment helpers, runbooks, and version/status material.
It is intended to make repeatable work easier to inspect; it is not a security
certification, managed service, autonomous agent, or substitute for engineering
judgment.

The standard is built around a simple principle: an idea becomes production work
only through explicit decisions, evidence, and accountable operators. Scripts
can collect inputs, run checks, and invoke vendor CLIs. They cannot establish
your compliance, own your data, approve your release, or guarantee service
availability.

## Scope and version reality

The current G1 implementation is cross-platform: the Node CLI is launched with
`npm run wtl:menu`, and `npm run sync:system:check` checks generated operational
surfaces for drift. macOS Apple Silicon, Windows 11 x64/ARM64, Ubuntu, and WSL
are documented with their support levels in [Platform Matrix](Platform-Matrix).
Capabilities are represented as supported only after implementation, testing,
review, and release.
