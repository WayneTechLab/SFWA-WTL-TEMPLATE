# SYSTEMX Long-Term Warnings

Production risk compounds over time. A successful first deploy does not prove
that a system will remain safe, affordable, compatible, or compliant.

- Cloud providers, SDKs, browsers, operating systems, prices, quotas, and
  support lifecycles change. Track the services you depend on.
- Firebase rules, IAM policies, authorized domains, and billing settings can
  drift as teams and requirements change. Review them regularly.
- Dependencies, GitHub Actions, MCP servers, and AI tools are supply-chain
  dependencies. Pin, review, update, and remove them deliberately.
- Agents and subagents multiply token and tool consumption. They can also
  duplicate work, make incorrect inferences, or expose context too broadly.
- AI output is untrusted until it is reviewed, tested, and approved by a human
  accountable for the resulting change.
- “Auto deploy” should never mean “unreviewed deploy.” Production changes need
  explicit authority, observable evidence, and a rollback plan.
- Privacy, accessibility, consumer protection, export control, tax, employment,
  and sector-specific requirements vary by location and product. Obtain advice
  appropriate to the jurisdiction.
