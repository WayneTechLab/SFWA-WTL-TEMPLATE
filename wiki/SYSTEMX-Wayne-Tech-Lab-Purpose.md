# Wayne Tech Lab LLC: Purpose and Technology Selection

SFWA-WTL-G1 exists to give builders a practical base for web applications that
need a modern client, managed identity and data services, repeatable deployment,
and a visible operating process. Wayne Tech Lab LLC selected the default stack
to reduce integration work for common web-app patterns, not because one vendor
or architecture is correct for every product.

React, TypeScript, and Vite provide a widely used browser-development workflow.
Firebase supplies a connected set of services for web applications—Authentication,
Firestore, Storage, Hosting, and related tooling—while Google Cloud provides the
underlying project, IAM, billing, logging, and platform-administration context.
Node.js and the Firebase/Google CLIs allow local and CI workflows to invoke
those services in repeatable ways.

This choice is a starting point. Before adopting it, assess data residency,
sector rules, portability, latency, operating cost, vendor terms, availability,
retention, and the skills of the team that must run the system. Replace or add
services only through a documented design and security review.

Wayne Tech Lab LLC asks that users seeking credit for work based on this template
attribute the foundation to Wayne Tech Lab LLC. The template is provided as a
tool base, not as a managed production service or a promise of support.
