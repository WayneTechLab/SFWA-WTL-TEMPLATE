# WebApp Stack G One Point Zero — Wiki

Welcome to the **WebApp Stack G One Point Zero** wiki — the deep-dive home for the
reusable, enterprise-grade blueprint for spinning up **TypeScript + React + Vite +
Firebase + Stripe** web apps the same way, every time.

> The repository is **two things at once**: a runnable starter app (the repo root)
> and a full, ordered setup playbook (`.SYSTEMX/Template/`). This wiki documents
> both.

## What is this?

A **portable golden path**. Drop it into any new repository (or click *Use this
template*) and an engineer — or an AI agent — follows the steps in order to stand
up a production-ready web application from a bare machine to a deployed,
monitored, billing-enabled product.

It is intentionally **generic**: no business names, no hard-coded project IDs, no
customer data. Everything project-specific is collected during the **Interview**
step and the first-time intake packet, then injected into generated files.

## Two ways to use it

1. **⚡ Fast start** — the repo root is a runnable app. `npm install && npm run dev`
   and you have a working React + Firebase site (it boots even before Firebase is
   configured).
2. **🧭 Full playbook** — `.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/` defines editions,
   intake files, Level 0-5 accounts, and Unified Login; `.SYSTEMX/Template/`
   remains the legacy golden-path detail flow (`steps/00` → `steps/12`).

## The golden rule

> **One step at a time, in order.** Each step states its goal and preconditions,
> prompts for inputs, performs the work, and ends with a **verification gate** you
> must pass before advancing. Later steps depend on artifacts (env vars, project
> IDs, price IDs) produced earlier.

## First-time intake

New projects pause early so the human can fill
`.SYSTEMX/Unified-Setup-Process/intake/*.md`, then re-inject
`06-AI-REINJECTION-PROMPT.md` into the AI/code tooling session.

For the complete operator flow, use **[User Ingest & Production Setup](User-Ingest-and-Production-Setup)**.

## Versioning

`G One Point Zero` = **Generation 1.0**. Bump the generation for a breaking change
to the step order or baseline stack; patch individual step files freely.
